- I thrive on turning complex technology into data-driven stories, intuitive product demos, and customer value.
- Equally comfortable partnering with engineers, executives, or customers, I bridge product strategy with engineering execution.
- I believe engineering success rests on three pillars: People, Product, and Traction.
- My growth has been accelerated by many wonderful mentors, and I pay it forward by mentoring interns and early-career professionals.

**Beyond work:**
+ Founder of CampML.org, a community-driven ML bootcamp
+ Active K-12 STEM volunteer and hackathon mentor
+ Maker at heart — experimenting with robotics, IoT, 3D printing, and AI art
